>**Abstract:** Inspired by the ability of StyleGAN to generate highly realistic
images in a variety of domains, much recent work has
focused on understanding how to use the latent spaces of
StyleGAN to manipulate generated and real images. However,
discovering semantically meaningful latent manipulations
typically involves painstaking human examination of
the many degrees of freedom, or an annotated collection
of images for each desired manipulation. In this work, we
explore leveraging the power of recently introduced Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models in order
to develop a text-based interface for StyleGAN image
manipulation that does not require such manual effort. We
first introduce an optimization scheme that utilizes a CLIP-based
loss to modify an input latent vector in response to a
user-provided text prompt. Next, we describe a latent mapper
that infers a text-guided latent manipulation step for
a given input image, allowing faster and more stable textbased
manipulation. Finally, we present a method for mapping
a text prompts to input-agnostic directions in StyleGANâ€™s
style space, enabling interactive text-driven image
manipulation. Extensive results and comparisons demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches.


## Description
Official Implementation of StyleCLIP, a method to manipulate images using a driving text. 
Our method uses the generative power of a pretrained StyleGAN generator, and the visual-language power of CLIP.
In the paper we present three methods: 
- Latent vector optimization.
- Latent mapper, trained to manipulate latent vectors according to a specific text description.
- Global directions in the StyleSpace.

We are still working to put all the code. 
Currently, the repository contains the code for the optimization and for the global directions.
The work is still in progress -- stay tuned!

## Updates
**2/4/2021** Add the global directions code (a local GUI and a colab notebook)

**31/3/2021** Upload paper to arxiv, and video to YouTube

**14/2/2021** Initial version

## Setup  (for all three methods)
For all the methods described in the paper, is it required to have:
- Anaconda
- [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)

Specific requirements for each method are described in its section. 
To install CLIP please run the following commands:
  ```shell script
conda install --yes -c pytorch pytorch=1.7.1 torchvision cudatoolkit=<CUDA_VERSION>
pip install ftfy regex tqdm gdown
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```


## Editing via Latent Vector Optimization

### Setup

Here, the code relies on the [Rosinality](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch/) pytorch implementation of StyleGAN2.
Some parts of the StyleGAN implementation were modified, so that the whole implementation is native pytorch.

In addition to the requirements mentioned before, a pretrained StyleGAN2 generator will attempt to be downloaded, (or manually download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EM87UquaoQmk17Q8d5kYIAHqu0dkYqdT/view?usp=sharing)).

### Usage

Given a textual description, one can both edit a given image, or generate a random image that best fits to the description.
Both operations can be done through the `main.py` script, or the `optimization_playground.ipynb` notebook ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/orpatashnik/StyleCLIP/blob/main/optimization_playground.ipynb)).

#### Editing
To edit an image set `--mode=edit`. Editing can be done on both provided latent vector, and on a random latent vector from StyleGAN's latent space.
It is recommended to adjust the `--l2_lambda` according to the desired edit. 

#### Generating Free-style Images
To generate a free-style image set `--mode=free_generation`.


## Editing via Global Direction

Here we provide GUI for editing images with the global directions. 
We provide both a jupyter notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/orpatashnik/StyleCLIP/blob/main/StyleCLIP_global.ipynb),
and the GUI used in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5icI0NgALnQ).
For both, the linear direction are computed in **real time**.
The code is located at `global/`.

  
### Setup
Here, we rely on the [official](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) TensorFlow implementation of StyleGAN2.

It is required to have TensorFlow, version 1.14 or 1.15 (`conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu==1.14`).

### Usage


#### Local GUI

To start the local GUI please run the following commands:

```shell script
cd global

# input dataset name 
dataset_name='ffhq' # input dataset name, currently, only support ffhq

# input prepare data 
python GetCode.py --dataset_name $dataset_name --code_type 'w'
python GetCode.py --dataset_name $dataset_name --code_type 's'
python GetCode.py --dataset_name $dataset_name --code_type 's_mean_std'

# interactively manipulation 
python PlayInteractively.py --dataset_name $dataset_name
```

As shown in the video, to edit an image it is requires to write a _neutral text_ and a _target text_. 
To operate the GUI, please do the following:
- Maximize the window size
- Double click on the left square to choose an image. The images are taken from  `global/data/ffhq`, and the corresponding latent vectors are in `global/data/ffhq/w_plus.npy`.
- Type a neutral text, then press enter
- Modify the target text so that it will contain the target edit, then press enter.

You can now play with:
- *Manipulation strength* - positive values correspond to moving along the target direction.
- *Disentanglement threshold* - large value means more disentangled edit, just a few channels will be manipulated so only the target attribute will change (for example, grey hair). Small value means less disentangled edit, a large number of channels will be manipulated, related attributes will also change (such as wrinkle, skin color, glasses).

##### Examples:

| Edit  | Neutral Text | Target Text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smile  | face  | smiling face |
| Gender  | female face  | male face |
| Blonde hair | face with hair | face with blonde hair |
| Hi-top fade | face with hair | face with Hi-top fade hair |
| Blue eyes | face with eyes | face with blue eyes |

More examples could be found in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5icI0NgALnQ) and in the paper.


##### Pratice Tips: 
In the terminal, for every manipulation, the number of channels being manipulated is printed (the number is controlled by the attribute (neutral, target) and the disentanglement threshold).

1. For color transformation, usually 10-20 channels is enough. For large structure change (for example, Hi-top fade), usually 100-200 channels are required.
2. For an attribute (neutral, target), if you give a low disentanglement threshold, there are just few channels (<20) being manipulated, and usually it is not enough for performing the desired edit.


#### Notebook
Open the notebook in colab and run all the cells. In the last cell you can play with the image.

`beta` corresponds to the *disentanglement threshold*, and `alpha` to the *manipulation strength*. 

After you set the desired set of parameters, please run again the last cell to generate the image.

## Editing Examples

In the following, we show some results obtained with our methods. 
All images are real, and were inverted into the StyleGAN's latent space using [e4e](https://github.com/omertov/encoder4editing). 
The driving text that was used for each edit appears below or above each image.

## Related Works

The global directions we find for editing are direction in the _S Space_, which was introduced and analyzed in [StyleSpace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12799) (Wu et al).

To edit real images, we inverted them to the StyleGAN's latent space using [e4e](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02766) (Tov et al.).
